# mnist-math-classifier

This project implements and compares three machine learning classifiers—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The dataset is preprocessed using image normalization and StandardScaler, and models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key features:
 -Data preprocessing with normalization and scaling
 -Training and evaluation of multiple classifiers
 -Model performance comparison using classification reports
 
 Results: The models achieve validation accuracies of ~93-94%, with Random Forest and KNN performing slightly better than SVM.
